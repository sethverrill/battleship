# Battleship

## Game description
We created a Battleship game that is a computer adaptation of the original 'Salvo' game from 1931. In this game you have a few ships that you place on your board and your opponent, the computer, places ships and it is a race to sink your opponents ships. 
## Details
We built in some additional features such as choosing your game board size and creating a custom ship. 

### Written Reflection
1. Even though there wasn't an interaction pattern there were enough requirements laid out in the instructions to fumble through writing tests using those requirements. We did some spiking where we wrote a placeholder test and then we made attempts at the method and then as we observed how the method behaved in pry or read our error messages, we rewrote the tests to match the method and edge cases.
2. If we had one more day we would work on custom feedback that could change depending on the iteration so that the game could have more character.
3. For most of the project we used the ping/pong paired programming strategy where one person wrote the test and the other person wrote the corresponding code. We did this for all of our classes and for the runner file we both made an attempt to write the code and then once it was working we did the driver/navigator strategy to fix bugs, render and tweak the file until optimal functionality.
4. During our DTR meeting we realized that we had scheduling conflicts that would prevent us from working synchronously together, so we decided to meet in the morning before zoom classes to have a daily check in and to delegate work for the day. This was a good time for us to also clarify any code or pull requests from the day before. In general we were as descriptive as we could be in our commits and in our pull request comments to lay a foundation for feedback. In the pull requests we described the parts of code that felt solid and the parts of the code that might have needed to be changed or rendered. After that if the other person was working on the same file they were given permission to make changes to code to help it function and pass tests since we were using the ping/pong pairing strategy.
